            <td><code>cd</code></td>
            <td>
                If you type <code>cd</code> and press the Return key—with no directory specified—you’ll go back to your Home folder.
                (You can also type <code>cd ~</code> to go there.)<br>
                If you type <code>cd /</code>, you’ll go to the root level of your startup disk.<br>
                If you type <code>cd ..</code> (that’s two periods), you’ll go to the directory above the one you’re currently in.
                So if you’re in your home folder and type <code>cd ..</code>, you’ll go to your Mac’s /Users folder.<br>
                And if you type <code>cd -</code> (hyphen), you’ll go back to the directory you were in before the last time you issued the <code>cd</code> command.

        <tr>
            <td><code>mkdir</code></td>
            <td>To create a new folder (directory), use the <code>mkdir</code> command followed by the folder name. For example, to create a folder named "NewFolder," use: <code>mkdir NewFolder</code>.</td>
        </tr>

            <td><code>touch</code></td>
            <td>To create a new file, you can use a text editor or the <code>touch</code> command in the terminal.
            The <code>touch</code> command is often used to create an empty file. For example, to create a file named "newfile.txt," use: <code>touch newfile.txt</code>.</td>

            <td><code>rm</code></td>
            <td>To delete or remove a file, use the <code>rm</code> command followed by the file name.
            Be cautious, as this action is permanent and cannot be easily undone.
            For example, to remove a file named "file.txt," use: <code>rm file.txt</code>.</td>

            <td>To remove a folder and its contents recursively, use the <code>rm -r</code> command followed by the folder name.
            Be extremely careful when using this command, as it permanently deletes the folder and all its contents.
            For example, to remove a folder named "MyFolder" and all its contents, use: <code>rm -r MyFolder</code>.</td>

            For example, to move a file named "file.txt" from the current directory to a folder named "Documents," use: <code>mv file.txt Documents/</code>.</td>

        <tr>
            <td><code>mv</code></td>
            <td>To rename a file, use the <code>mv</code> command and provide the current filename as the source and the new filename as the destination.
